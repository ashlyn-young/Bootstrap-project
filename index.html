<!-- Make sure to ask if a carousel is necessary for this project. It's linked but not mentioned in the requirements at all.. If carousel IS needed,
does it need to have buttons or just be on auto play?-->

<!-- Need to select a background image -->

<!-- Is the nav bar at the bottom where I'm using modals? Or is it the 'Start learning now' button. -->
<!-- Content included? Do I need to include videos or no? Is it just meaning that it needs to look like their example? -->
